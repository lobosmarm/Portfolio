# Portfolio 

This is the portfolio website for Melissa Villalobos

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the website.
- `/assets/`: Contains static assets like images and your résumé.
    - `/assets/images/`: Stores images for the site and projects.
    - `/assets/logos/`: (Optional) Stores any logos.
- `/projects/`: Contains individual folders for each project, with a markdown file (`index.md`) for the project details.
- `/styles/`: Contains the main CSS file (`main.css`).
- `README.md`: This file.

## To Get Started

1.  **Replace Placeholders:** Go through the `index.html` and the markdown files in `/projects/` and replace all the `TODO:` comments with your actual content, images, and links.
2.  **Add Your Résumé:** Make sure your résumé PDF is in the `/assets/resume/` folder and is named `your-resume.pdf` (or update the link in `index.html`).
3.  **Add Project Details:** Create folders in the `/projects/` directory for each project you want to showcase. In each folder, create an `index.md` file and fill it with the details of your project using markdown syntax.
4.  **Style Your Site:** Edit the `styles/main.css` file to customize the appearance of your portfolio. Pay attention to colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness.
5.  **Implement Interactions:** If you want to add the animated highlight/underline effect or any other JavaScript interactions, add your code in the `<script>` tags at the end of `index.html` or in a separate `.js` file linked in the `<head>`.
6.  **Update Job Application Tracker:** Manually update the list in the `<footer>` of `index.html` with your current job applications.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

## Further Customization

- Create a separate CSS file for project-specific styles if needed.
- Implement a contact form that sends submissions to your email address.
- Consider adding a blog section in the future.
